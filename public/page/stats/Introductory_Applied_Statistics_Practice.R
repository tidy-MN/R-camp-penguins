# Breakout Session 1: 

# Explore the cancer incidence dataset and identify some questions you
# could try to answer with the available data. Use some of the statistical tests 
# we covered (T-tests, Mann-Whitney U Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test,
# ANOVA, Chi-Squared Test, Correlation) along with any relevant visualizations
# to answer the questions you identified. Discuss the tests you conducted
# and your findings within the breakout session group. Be ready to share
# some of your findings once we reconvene from the breakout sessions.  




# Breakout Session 2: 

# Continue exploring the dataset, this time focusing on linear regression.
# Try building several models with various parameters, and make sure to
# interpert the results and coefficients. Discuss the models you selected and
# your findings with the rest of the breakout session group. Be ready to share
# some of your findings once we reconvene from the breakout sessions.
