> __What is an _R package_?__

<br>

A _package_ is a small add-on for R, it's like a phone App for your phone. 
They add capabilities like statistical functions, mapping powers, and special charts to R. In order to use a new package we first need to install it. Let's try it!

The _tidyverse_ package is an umbrella of helpful packages. One of the packages it includes is the _readr_ package, which helps import data into R in different formats. It also helps by cleaning the data of extra white space and formatting tricky date formats automatically.

__The 2 steps to using a package in R__

1. `install.packages("package-name")`
1. `library(package-name)`	

</div>


__Add a package to your library__  

1. Open _RStudio_ 
1. Type ` install.packages("tidyverse") ` in the lower left console
1. Press Enter
1. _Wait two seconds_
1. Open the `Packages` tab in the lower right window of RStudio to see the packages in your _library_
    - Use the search bar to find the `tidyverse` package

> Your installed packages are stored in your R _library_. The `Packages` tab on the right shows all of the available packages installed in your library. When you want to use one of them, you load it in R. 
>
> Loading a package is like opening an App on your phone. To load a package we use the `library()` function. You will need to load the package everytime you open RStudio. Once you load it, the package will stay loaded until you close RStudio.


Add the line below to the top of your R script and run it to load the `tidyverse`. A series of messages will appear in the console informing us of the loaded packages.

```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
```
