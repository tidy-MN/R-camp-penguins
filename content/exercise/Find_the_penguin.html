<h2>Exercise 1: filtering data</h2>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to filter a dataset using repeated filter commands until you only have one row of data left.</p>
<p>Using the <code>palmerpenguins</code> dataset, isolate a penguin who meets one of the following sets of criteria. What is its study number?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I am a female Adelie penguin hatched on November 12th on Biscoe Island. I was part of the latest study.</li>
<li>I am a male Chinstrap penguin weighing over 4kg. My culmen is over 50mm long, but my flippers are less than 200mm long.</li>
<li>I am a female Gentoo penguin weighing over 5kg, but my culmen is shorter at under 45mm.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a greater challenge, try to isolate these penguins.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I have the lowest weight of the male penguins.</li>
<li>I am the heaviest female Adelie penguin.</li>
<li>I have the longest flippers of the Adelie penguins on Dream Island.</li>
</ol>
