## Exercise 1: filtering data

The goal of this exercise is to filter a dataset using repeated filter commands until you only have one row of data left.

Using the `penguins` dataset in the `palmerpenguins` package, isolate a penguin who meets one of the following sets of criteria. What is its study number?

1. I am a female Adelie penguin hatched on November 12th on Biscoe Island. I was part of the latest study.
1. I am a male Chinstrap penguin weighing over 4kg. My bill is over 5cm long, but my flippers are less than 20cm long. 
1. I am a female Gentoo penguin weighing over 5kg, but my bill is shorter at under 4.5cm long. 

For a greater challenge, try to isolate these penguins.

1. I have the lowest weight of the male penguins.
1. I am the heaviest female Adelie penguin.
1. I have the longest flippers of the Adelie penguins on Dream Island.

## Exercise 2: using case_when

Select the same penguin that you selected above. Create a new variable using case_when that uses the criteria provided to identify your selected penguin and only your selected penguin in your dataset.

  Example: 
  `case_when(x == y ~ TRUE, .default = FALSE)`

  Example:
  `case_when(body_mass_g > 4000 ~ TRUE, .default = FALSE)`

  Example:
  `mutate(penguins, subject = case_when(body_mass_g > 4000 & bill_length_mm > 50 ~ TRUE, .default = FALSE))`
