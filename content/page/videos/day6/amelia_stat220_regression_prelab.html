<h2>Setup and packages</h2>
<p>We use three packages in this course: <code>Lock5Data</code>, <code>tidyverse</code> and <code>infer</code>. To load a package, you use the <code>library()</code> function, wrapped around the name of a package. I’ve put the code to load one package into the chunk below. Add the other two you need.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lock5Data)
# put in the other two packages you need here</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="loading-in-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Loading in data</h2>
<p>Let’s load the example dataset I have for this course, <code>GSS_clean.csv</code>. It should be inside the <code>data</code> folder in your RStudio Cloud. We’ll use the <code>read_csv()</code> function to read in the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># this is where data-loading code goes
GSS &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://tidy-mn.github.io/R-camp-penguins/data/GSS_clean.csv&quot;)</code></pre>

<h2>Data visualization for two quantitative variables</h2>
<p>Our main data visualization for two quantitative variables is a scatterplot.</p>
<p>To make our visualization, we will use the <code>ggplot()</code> function, with our data inside, and then use a <code>+</code> to add on a <code>geom_</code> to tell R what kind of plot we want. In this case, we want a <code>geom_point()</code> to make a scatterplot. Inside the <code>geom_</code> function, we use the <code>aes()</code> function and tell R how to map between variables in our dataset and variables in the plot. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(GSS) +
  geom_point(aes(x = highest_year_school_completed_spouse, y = highest_year_of_school_completed))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 1361 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).</code></pre>
<p><img src="/R-camp-penguins/page/videos/day6/amelia_stat220_regression_prelab_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As with our plots in the last lab, we get a warning message about missing values being removed.</p>
<p>Does this plot show a positive association, negative association, or no association? If it shows an association, how strong would you say it is?</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-statistics-for-two-quantitative-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary statistics for two quantitative variables</h2>
<p>One way to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship is with correlation. To find this, we use the <code>cor()</code> function inside our <code>summarize()</code> in a data pipeline.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>GSS %&gt;%
  summarize(correlation = cor(y = highest_year_of_school_completed, 
                              x = highest_year_school_completed_spouse))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   correlation
##         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1          NA</code></pre>
<p>Much like with our other summary statistics, this gives an <code>NA</code> value, because there are <code>NA</code> values in one or more of the variables in the dataset. We can use <code>drop_na()</code> on those two variables,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>GSS %&gt;%
  drop_na(highest_year_of_school_completed, highest_year_school_completed_spouse) %&gt;%
  summarize(correlation = cor(
    y = highest_year_of_school_completed,
    x = highest_year_school_completed_spouse))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 1
##   correlation
##         &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1       0.596</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="linear-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Linear models</h2>
<p>Another way to study the relationship between two quantitative variables is to fit a linear model. R has a function that does least squares regression, called <code>lm()</code> for linear model. This uses the formula syntax, which we’re not focusing on in this class. The syntax requires you to write <span class="math inline">\(y~x\)</span> to specify your response and explanatory variable, with a “tilde” in between. (The tilde is up above your Tab key on the keyboard, along with the “tick” ``<code>).  You can run the</code>lm()` function in your Console or RMarkdown document and get a little information about your model,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lm(highest_year_of_school_completed ~ highest_year_school_completed_spouse, data = GSS)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = highest_year_of_school_completed ~ highest_year_school_completed_spouse, 
##     data = GSS)
## 
## Coefficients:
##                          (Intercept)  highest_year_school_completed_spouse  
##                                5.847                                 0.594</code></pre>
<p>but, it’s better practice to assign your model object to a name, so you can refer back to it later, and get more information about it. Recall that the assignment operator in R is <code>&lt;-</code>. I usually call my models <code>m1</code>, <code>m2</code>, etc., but you could think of a better name to use (like <code>schoolmodel</code> or similar) to remind you what it’s about.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m1 &lt;- lm(highest_year_of_school_completed ~ highest_year_school_completed_spouse, data = GSS)</code></pre>
<p>When we run this code, nothing prints out. But, a new object should appear in our RStudio Environment pane. Now, we can run R functions on that model object. The most useful one is <code>summary()</code>,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m1 %&gt;%
  summary()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = highest_year_of_school_completed ~ highest_year_school_completed_spouse,

<p>The same model coefficients are shown here, but there is also a lot more information about things like the <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value.</p>
<div id="interpreting-coefficients" class="section level3">
<h3>Interpreting coefficients</h3>
<p>Let’s interpret our model coefficients. Here are the generic sentences I prefer:</p>
<p><strong>Intercept</strong> If the value of [explanatory variable] was zero, our model would predict [response variable] to be [intercept value].</p>
<p><strong>Slope</strong> For a one-[unit] increase in [explanatory variable], our model would predict a [slope value]-[unit] [increase/decrease] in [response variable].</p>
<p>Let’s apply that to this model:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="predicting-values" class="section level2">
<h2>Predicting values</h2>
<p>Models are also useful for prediction. There are more programmatic ways to do prediction in R, but for now I recommend you just use R as a big calculator. Let’s see what the model would predict for a person whose spouse had completed 12 years of school (high school):</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
</div>
<div id="residuals" class="section level2">
<h2>Residuals</h2>
<p>We are also interested in whether our model overpredicts or underpredicts certain points. We can compute a residual, which is <span class="math inline">\(observed - expected\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y_i-\hat{y}_i\)</span>. Look at row 21 in the dataset. It represents a 34-year-old person with one child whose spouse completed 12 years of school. What is the observed value of <code>highest_year_of_school_completed</code> for this person? What is their residual?</p>
