## Get the data {-}

We can download the attached Excel file [HERE]()

After you've downloaded the file, move the file from your *Downloads/* folder to a *data/* folder in your project's main directory:

1. Download the Excel file
2. Create a "data" folder in your project directory
  - You can do this the usual way with Windows Explorer, or use the built-in New Folder button in the RStudio `Files` pane.
3. Move the Excel file from your *Downloads/* folder to the new *data/* folder. 


## <i class="fas fa-file-excel" aria-hidden="true"></i> Excel in R {-}

Have an EXCEL file? The **readxl** package has the function `read_excel()` for reading Excel data into R.


### Let's install and load `readxl`: {-}

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages(readxl)

library(readxl)
```


### Now we can read in our Excel file: {-}
```{r, eval=F}
crew_df <- read_excel("data/crew_food_prefs.XLSX")
```

> Ope! What happened to our column names / headers?

<br>

```{r, eval=F}
crew_df <- read_excel("data/crew_food_prefs.XLSX", skip = 1)
```

<br>

### An Excellent alternative {-}

```{r fun-options, child='../../static/modules/readr/readr_csv/excel_csv.Rmd'}
```


```{r, include=F}
crew_df <- read_csv("data/crew_food_prefs.csv")
```


## Glimpse the data {-}

```{r,eval=F}
glimpse(crew_df)

summary(crew_df)
```


## **`filter()`** out the test data {-}

There appears to be test data included in the table. Yuk! Let's filter it out so it doesn't influence our results.

```{r}
crew_df <- filter(crew_df, id != "test")
```


## **`select()`** what we need {-}

There's also some columns in here we don't need. Let's drop the country people are from since that won't help us.

```{r}
crew_df <- select(crew_df, -country)
```

<br>

Let's create a separate smaller `favorites` table with only the `id` and `favorite_goody` columns.

```{r}
favorites_df <- select(crew_df, id, favorite_goody)
```

<br>

Let's create a separate `allergy` table with only the `id` and all of the columns that contain the word **"allergy"**.

```{r}
allergy_df <- select(crew_df, id, contains("allergy"))
```


<br>

Finally, for easier reference, use `select()` to make the `id` and `days_on_ship` columns the first two columns in the table. Everything else can be in the same order.

```{r}
favorites_df <- select(crew_df, id, days_on_ship, everything())
```


## **`arrange()`** the crew {-}

Let's use `arrange()` to sort the crew members so the ones that will be on the ship the longest are on top. They'll be the ones munching on are goodies the longest.

```{r}
crew_df <- arrange(crew_df, days_on_ship)
```

> Ope! What happened?


### Descending order (biggest on top) {-}
```{r}
crew_df <- arrange(crew_df, desc(days_on_ship))
```

### Alternative: use `-column_name` instead of `desc(column_name)` {-}
```{r}
crew_df <- arrange(crew_df, -days_on_ship)
```


## **`mutate()`** new columns {-}

Let's get an idea of the total meals each crew mate will be eating baked goods. For that, we'll need to take their `days_on_the_ship` times their `meals_per_day`.

```{r}
# Use the * to multiply and the / to divide
crew_df <- mutate(crew_df, total_trip_meals = days_on_the_ship * meals_per_day)
```


### Sidebar: Counting TRUE's and FALSE's {-}
```{r}
# This new column wouldn't be too helpful
crew_df <- mutate(crew_df, no_egg_allergy = egg_allergy == FALSE)

## Drop it
crew_df <- select(crew_df, -no_egg_allergy)


# Let's show whether someone has any allergies
## Note: TRUE's count as 1, and FALSE's count as 0
crew_df <- mutate(crew_df, 
                  n_allergies = egg_allergy + nut_allergy)

# This is the same
crew_df <- mutate(crew_df, 
                  n_allergies = egg_allergy == TRUE + nut_allergy == TRUE)

# This is also the same
crew_df <- mutate(crew_df, 
                  n_allergies = sum(egg_allergy, nut_allergy))

```

> You know, it'd be great if we could label the crew that were going to be on board less than a week. Sounds like it's time to expand our data toolbox...
